# Computational Content Analysis Final Project

by Chen Liang, MACSS 2021
* I did not upload any data related to this final project due to their sizes. Please let me know if I need to send them to you.
* The `data_processing` file contains three steps of data processing: 1) web_scrape_x, which web-scrape the interested websites. 2) clean_rescrape_x, which clean the data on both text and sentence level, and rescrape certain webpages when necessary. 3) tokenization_x, which tokenize the data and store them as csvs.
* The rest of the notebooks analyze the text data step by step. I didn't comment too much on the specific code, because they correspond very closely to my final report.
